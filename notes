    >>> jackhammer = sr.AudioFile('jackhammer.wav')
    >>> with jackhammer as source:
    ...     audio = r.record(source)
    ...
    >>> r.recognize_google(audio)
    'the snail smell of old gear vendors'

how do you deal with this?^^ One thing you can try is using the adjust_for_ambient_noise()

>>> with jackhammer as source:
...     r.adjust_for_ambient_noise(source)
...     audio = r.record(source)
...
>>> r.recognize_google(audio)
'still smell of old beer vendors'
